, "description": "This is an experimental library for structuring code. It is based on Arrowized FRP, which aimed to provide an API for higher-order signal graphs. There are many ways to structure code though, and it is not yet clear when AFRP is a superior method. So this library is meant to explore the basics of AFRP and find cases where it is a really good fit."
